# Bioactivity Classification of Natural Products Using LC-MS/MS Metabolomics
## Overview
This repository contains the data and Python scripts used in the research project titled "Machine Learning-based Bioactivity Classification of Natural Products Using LC-MS/MS Metabolomics". The project focuses on developing a machine learning (ML) framework to characterize the bioactivity of natural products by leveraging LC-MS/MS metabolomics data. This research aims to address the challenge of rediscovery in natural products drug discovery by utilizing in-silico-generated molecular fingerprints (MFPs) to classify compounds based on their core pharmacophores.

## Key Features
Machine Learning Framework: Developed to classify compounds into 23 diverse bioactive drug classes, achieving >93% accuracy on experimental spectra.
Molecular Fingerprints (MFPs): Created using SIRIUS 5 and in-silico generated fragmentation spectra to enable classification of natural products even without reference experimental spectra.
Tools Used: Utilizes computational tools such as SIRIUS, Mass Frontier, and scikit-learn for generating and analyzing metabolomics data.
Bioactivity Classification: Demonstrates the utility of pharmacophore-based classification, outperforming existing methods such as CANOPUS in identifying known bioactive compounds.

## Project Workflow
### 1. Data Generation:

- In-silico MS/MS spectra are generated using Mass Frontier for a diverse set of natural product structures.
- SIRIUS 5 is used to generate molecular fingerprints (MFPs) from the in-silico data.

### 2. Machine Learning Model:

- Multiple machine learning models are trained using scikit-learn, including Support Vector Classifiers (SVC), Ridge Classifiers, and more.
- Models are evaluated on both in-silico generated and experimental GNPS spectra to classify bioactive compounds into 23 drug classes.

### 3. Performance Metrics:

- Classification models achieve over 93% accuracy, with low false-positive rates across all drug classes.
- The models outperformed traditional classification tools, especially in predicting polyene macrolides and other antifungal drug classes.
